Many people are wondering if the real estate market will remain hot or if we're headed for a downturn as vaccination rates rise and the economy reopens. In this article, we look back at 2020, assess where we are now, and examine real estate market forecasts for the rest of 2021.",

            text: "The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to nearly zero at the start of the pandemic last year. While this move intended to aid an economy that was suddenly in crisis due to the closure of businesses and schools, it also contributed to last year's rising home prices and limited supply. Many homeowners refinanced their mortgages, and others took out home equity loans or lines of credit to finance renovation projects when mortgage interest rates fell to historically low levels last year. People added home offices, family rooms, and other new spaces as we adjusted to the new social distancing way of life or improved kitchens and bathrooms that were suddenly seeing a lot more use. While many homeowners chose to stay put and improve their spaces, others, particularly those living in densely populated urban areas, felt compelled to upgrade to a larger home and/or acquire more outdoor space. As a result, a supply-and-demand situation arose, with a large number of buyers and fewer sellers than usual. The real estate market in Illinois was impacted by the same trends that were seen across the country in 2020. Home sales increased in 2020, while inventory decreased, according to Illinois REALTORS®. Last year, annual closed sales increased by 9.6%, while the annual median sales price increased by 7.7%. Meanwhile, the number of homes for sale in Illinois fell by 38.8 percent between 2018 and 2019. Despite the uncertainty and economic pain caused by the pandemic, the Illinois housing market reached a high point in 2020. The question now is whether the real estate market will remain hot until 2021.",

            text: "According to the most recent market update from Illinois REALTORS®, \"as consumers' appetite for homes coincided with the traditional real estate season, a reduced inventory led to faster sales and higher median prices in May. \" Closed sales and median sales price are up from May 2020, inventory is down 45.7 percent, and days on the market until sale are down 20 days from last year. As a result, the Illinois housing market will remain hot into the first half of 2021, with demand outstripping supply and many listings receiving multiple offers above the asking price. The big question is how long it will last. According to an Illinois REALTORS® market forecast for 2021, \"median prices are forecast to grow in 2021 within a higher and broader range than in 2020,\" and \"sales are forecast to experience overall positive gains in 2021 for Illinois. \"In particular, average mortgage rates are expected to remain around 3%, which may encourage homebuyers to act now to lock in these historically low rates.",

When the economy collapsed at the start of the pandemic, more than a million people in the state lost their jobs, and mortgage delinquencies reached new highs. Unfortunately, that trend has continued into 2021, with Illinois having the second-highest rate of foreclosures in March. People start talking about a crash whenever the housing market heats up, but there is no data to support an impending crash. There are still many variables to contend with in real estate, as there are in every other sector of the economy's recovery. As an example, In the Illinois REALTORS® 2021 market forecast, \"The uneven impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment by sector and income level is likely to be reflected in the housing market in 2021,\" said Geoffrey J.D. Hewings, Director of the University of Illinois' Regional Economics Applications Laboratory. Increasing remote work opportunities for white-collar workers may drive demand in suburban and exurban areas with larger homes, layoffs, and furloughs for retail, leisure, and hospitality workers may reduce supply and demand in the bottom quarter of the price distribut ",
